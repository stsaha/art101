			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="img/portrait.jpg" width="700">
			<p> Hello! My name is Sohinee and I am third-year undergraduate student pursuing a double major in Biomolecular Engineering and Art at UC Santa Cruz! I was born and raised in the Bay Area and continue to live here with my parents and older brother, an UCSC alum!</p>

			<p>I am a natural introvert and you can frequently find me at home napping with my imaginary dog, cooking Middle Eastern or Indian food, plearning the ukulele, and bing-watching Turkish shows! But I also love traveling, spending time in nature, discovering handmade jewelry, and going on long night drives!</p>

			<p> In the near future, I hope to attend graduate school, join the biomedical research field, and do some volunteer work in the Middle East.</p>
