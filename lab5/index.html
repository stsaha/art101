			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to gain practice using Javascript. At the same time, this lab encourages the incorporation of new CSS elements. I also found the exact name for the color of my car!</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Though I did not have many issues, learning Javascript and understanding how all the files worked together took some extra time.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> The output of my Javascript file are embedded below and correspond to the image on the right, which I found on the web.</p>
