			<h1> LAB 12 - CONDITIONALS </h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to gain practice using conditionals. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I did not really run into any issues as I have worked with conditionals before and found the code provided by the professor on Canvas helpful.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> I was successfully able to determine which house an user belongs to based on the name he/she inputted. </p>

			<div class = "input-output">
				<h3> Welcome to Hogwarts! </h3>
				<p> Prepare to be sorted into your house! </p>
				Please enter your name for sorting: <input type="text" id="input"><br/>
				<button id="button">Submit</button>
				<div id="output" ></div>
			</div>
