				<h1> LAB 16 - JSON & APIs </h1>
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to experiment with processing JSON from an API. </p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> Unfortunately, I did run into problems when testing the API endpoint. In my previous lab, I incorporated the Google Maps API quite smoothly and do wish that the site provided more guidance for how to use the JSON interface to access their comics. I received an Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP response message as part of a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error. </p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> Due to my errors, I was not able to produce the required output for this lab. The console, however, does show the errors that are encountered and were unable to resolve. This lab really did test my patience, but nevertheless, if I do have time, I do hope to return to this lab and work on it again!</p>
