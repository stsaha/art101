			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions </h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to write functions that can accept and manipulate user input, and in particular, strings. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I did encounter any large issues. However, when createing my function in the javascript file, I accidently used 'console.long' instead of 'console.long' for a line near its end. As a result, no output was being printed and I had to debug the function line-by-line until I caught the issue and my function was properly working.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> The output of my Javascript file is embedded below.</p>
				<div class=output>
					<h3>Script Output</h3>
        	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
				</div>
			<p> I also did some experimenting with how the built-in sort() function works. If given an input that contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, the function will give priority to the uppercase laters, sorting them first before considering the lowercase letters. As a result, an alphabetical sort may not always be achieved. A solution to this problem, however, is making all the letters lowercase or uppercase before it is further manipulated. In my case, I chose to use the built-in toLowerCase() function to make sure the username is lowercase in its entirety before it is sorted. </p>
