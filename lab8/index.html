			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I did not encounter any large issues for this lab. There was some confusion of using the function as a callback, but once I experimented with them, I got the hang of it.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> Once I received the expected results in the console, I placed the code in the lab's javascript file. Additionally, I successfully completed the Extra Credit task by displaying my results on the page, which can be seen below:</p>

			<div id="output"></div>
			<script>
				var outputEl = document.getElementById("output");
				outputEl.innerHTML = cubes;
			</script>
