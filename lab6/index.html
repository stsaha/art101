			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to gain practice using Javascript, and in particular, become familiar with arrays and objects. As with other labs, it also encourages the incorporation of new CSS elements. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I did not really have any problems, but something that was I found surprising was the fact that we do not put "var" before declaring an array.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> The output of my Javascript file are embedded below and correspond to the image on the right, which I found on the web.</p>
				<h3>Script Output</h3>
