			<h1>Lab 10 - Javascript Events and Forms </h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to experiment with Javascript events and forms with the use of buttons. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>While I did not encounter any large issues for this lab, I did have some trouble and had to take some additional time to understand how I needed to split the code between the two files in order for the button to work properly.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> I was successfully able to incorporate JS forms to attain user input and use a button to deliver the manipulated input as output. In the form below, one may enter his/her username, and if the button is clicked, he/she will be redirected to a page that sorts the letters of the username in alphabetical order. I also did some more experimentation with buttons and completed the Extra Credit task by being able to change the background color of the page to light blue if the button below is clicked. </p>

			<button onclick = "blue()">Change Background</button>

			<form>
				 Input your name:   <input type="text" id="name"><br/>
			</form>
			<input id="my-button" type="button" value="Click" onClick="nameSort()"><br/>
			<div id="output" ></div>
