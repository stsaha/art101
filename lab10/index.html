			<h1>Lab 10 - Javascript Events and Forms </h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to experiment with Javascript events and forms with the use of buttons. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>While I did not encounter any large issues for this lab, I did have some trouble and had to take some additional time to understand how I needed to split the code between the two files in order for the button to work properly.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> I was successfully able to incorporate JS forms to attain user input and use a button to deliver the manipulated input as output. In the form below, one may enter his/her username, and if the button is clicked, he/she will be redirected to a page that sorts the letters of the username in alphabetical order. </p>
			
			<form>
				 Input your name:   <input type="text" id="name"><br/>
			</form>
			<input id="my-button" type="button" value="Click" onClick="nameSort()"><br/>
			<div id="output" ></div>
