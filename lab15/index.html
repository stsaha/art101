				<h1> LAB 15 - AJAX </h1>
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to experiment with jQuery and AJAX. </p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> For this lab, I decided to incorporate the Google Maps API on my website. Though it was fun to be able to incorporate this element that I see among so many other sites on a daily basis, I did struggle quite a lot with generating the API key. Ulitametly, I generated a new key which suprisingly worked.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> My incorporation of the Google Maps API can be seen below. I did not want to pay for the full implementation, so the API was implemented "for developmental purposes only." </p>
