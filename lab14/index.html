			<h1> LAB 14 - DEBUGGING </h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to gain practice debugging. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Since none of my prior labs had any problems to fix, I did not have to debug them.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> Instead, I completed the Extra Credit assignment by creating a stackoverflow account and answering a basic Javascript question that was left unanswered for the user. </p>
