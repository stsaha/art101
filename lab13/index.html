			<h1> LAB 13 - CONDITIONALS </h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to gain practice using loops. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I did not run into any issues for the main tasks of the lab, however, figuring out how to organize the output in columns did take some extra time.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> I was successfully able to implement a Javascript function that uses loops to deliver specific results for certain conditions. As part of the Extra Credit task, I was also able to print in the output in 10 columns. </p>
