	<h1> Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving </h1>

	<div class = "challenge-section">
		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The primary purpose of this lab is to gain practice writing both abstract/high-level and detailed pseudocode. This lab also incorporates more creativity by using CSS stylesheets. </p>
	</div>

	<div class = "problems-section">
	 	<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> As someone with some programming experience, I have written pseudocode before and used this lab as an opportunity to brush up my skills and remind myself of what consistutes effective pseudocode.</p>
	</div>

	<div class = "results-section">
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> The two pseudocodes I created can be seen below. The first pseudocode is for how to cook menemem (Turkish scrambled eggs), a non-computer task. The second pseudocode is for a hypothetical career-finding program. Since this lab also encouraged more work with CSS, the screenshot for the lab's stylesheet can be seen below the pseudocodes, along with a screenshotted portion of my HTML file. </p>

2. Create an array with variables for each career:
		- Use variables of type integer.
		- Array size is 10.
3. Ask the user several questions to understand his/her interests:
		- Prepare list of 10-15 questions.
4. Depending on input, increment career-related variables in the array:
		- If answer shows no releation to career type, do not increment.
		- If answer shows slight relation to career type, increment by +1.
		- If answer shows strong relation to career type, increment by +2.
5. Variable with greatest value in the array at the end is the chosen career:
		- Declare and initalize max variable to first value in array.
		- Use a for-loop to go through entire array.
		- If value of current element is > current max, replace max.
6. Deliver results to the user:
